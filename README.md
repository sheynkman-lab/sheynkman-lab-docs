# Good Practices In Storing Data

## Choosing storage media wisely

Not all storage locations are equally suitable for all types of storage:

* **Portable devices** are suitable for holding short term copies of your data file for transport, but  they are vulnerable for loss and there is no automatic back-up of your data. If you use portable devices, make sure you choose high quality products from reputable manufacturers, regularly check the media to make sure that they are not failing and periodically 'refresh' the data (that is, copy to a new CD, disk, or USB flash drive).
* **Cloud services** are suitable for collaboration with partners from outside the university, with the added benefit that they are not device specific. Be sure to check if your selected cloud service makes regular back-ups, if it falls under European jurisdiction and if it is a trustworthy partner. If not, this particular cloud service could be a bad idea.
* The **university network drives** (Rivanna Storage) are suitable if you collaborate with others within the university and are also not device specific. The back-ups here are made automatically and very regular.

## Manage versions and copies of your data carefully

In your day-to-day research make sure you manage the different versions and copies of your data carefully in the following ways:&#x20;

&#x20;

* **Protect raw data**\
  Your raw data, as you have collected it or have received it, is the basis of all analyses that you plan. With the raw data and the recorded steps of your analyses, you can retrace all of your results. So, it is important that raw data is not accidentally overwritten or changed. Store it in a separate, protected location, for instance a separate folder that is set to ‘read only’. Make a working copy of your raw data to do your actual analyses on. To check if the raw data is still the same, consider checking whether the data that you currently store is the same as the orginal. You can check data integrity with a [checksum-checker external link](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11533) or the md5 sum (for MAC or UNIX users this is provided by the operating system). &#x20;
* **Keep temporary and master copies apart**\
  Your working files are frequently changing. Imagine you have several copies at different locations. How do you keep track of what copy contains the updates you most recently made? If you choose the wrong file, it takes time to merge both documents afterwards. To avoid confusion, you select ONE place where the master copies of your work are located. All other copies are temporary and should be placed back or synchronised with the master copy location, at regular intervals, fixed times, or after each edit.
* **Back-up your master copy in physically distinct locations** \
  If there is a calamity or accident at your master copy location, all your work could be lost. It is important to have back-ups of your master data files, including one at a separate location. Back-ups are logically made from the master copy location, which should hold the most recent and correct version. Do not overwrite old back-ups; make a new one and delete the old, if necessary.\
  There are several back-up schemes to choose from. What you choose depends on how much time a back-up takes, how much space you have, whether it is costly, and what your risk is to lose important information between back-ups. You either always do a full back-up of all files, or partial back-ups. Consider backing-up important or dynamic data more often. In case of large file sizes, you could decide to back-up only the most essential elements.\
  Some master copy locations provide automatic back-up. In that case, at least inform yourself on the scheme used. Also, make sure that the back-up location is as secure as your master copy location. Moreover, check if the time and effort needed to restore a back-up copy is acceptable for you and strategically retain back-ups for prolonged time.
* **Set up a strategy for version control**\
  Versioning ensures tracking the development of a data file and identifying earlier versions, when needed. The simplest way to identify a particular version is to add an extension to the file name such as 'v1.00', 'v1.01', 'v2.06' with ordinal numbers indicating major and decimals minor changes. As long as the original 'raw' and definitive copy are retained and processing is well documented, the intermediate working files can be discarded. Keep only the major versions for longer term retention. In a version control table (or file history or log file) you can document what is new or different in each major version that you keep.&#x20;

## Structure names and folders

As your work progresses, it is likely that you’ll have more and more files, all with different content. Finding the exact file that you need can be a hassle if you do not have a logical folder structure or logical file names. Think on naming conventions and folder structure before you start a project. It is easier to maintain a manageable number of files and versions with a clear naming and folder structure and can save you a lot of frustration. If files are to be shared in a shared file space, standardised file-naming conventions are even more important. Think about the:

&#x20;

* **Folder structure** \
  Before you start your project, think of a logical folder structure. Anticipate the kind of files you will produce and envision folders for those files. Not too flat, not too deep. About three steps down is workable. Make it stable and scalable, so you can expand without having to rearrange the structure completely. Don't use folders with possibly overlapping contents on the same level. \
  A well-arranged folder structure in which folders and sub-folders are hierarchical and follow each other logically, is invaluable in quickly navigating your data and finding what you require. It can be very helpful to draw up your folder structure in a diagram in your DMP.&#x20;
* **File naming** \
  Some do's and dont's:
  * Employ clear file names. Build your file names from elements. Elements could be project name, project number, name of research team/department, measurement type, subject, date of creation, version number, etc. Each element is coded to keep names short.
  * Keep file names short. About 25 characters is a good length for a filename.
  * Keep a log file where you explain your coded elements, so outsiders, collaborators, supervisors, or yourself in a years’ time, will be able to crack the codes. Your data management plan is a good place to document your file naming conventions.
  * Always go from generic to specific. This will help you find sets of files with a simple sorting of filenames in your folder.
  * Only use characters from the sets A-Z, a-z, 0-9, hyphen, underscore, and dot. Don't use special characters such as &%$#), as different operating systems can assign different meaning to those characters. An example of a file name could be ‘NTC\_wp5\_MA\_exp1.csv’ (project, work package within the project, type of measurement, experiment ID of the measurement) or MicroArray\_NTC023\_20141031.xls (content description, project number, date: international standard).
  * Ensure file names are independent of location (this will avoid problems when moving files).

## Find and understand your data by assigning metadata

If you have data, you should inevitably have metadata. Metadata and documentation provide information about your data, such as the topic of your project or the circumstances under which your data were obtained. Without metadata and documentation, a lot of data are just numbers without any meaning. Therefore, this “data about data” is essential to understand, find, reuse and manage (the context of) your data.
